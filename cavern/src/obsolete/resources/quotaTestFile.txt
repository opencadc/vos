#  quotaTestFile.txt - File with size > 1K bytes to test quota limit. This file
#                      is used by integration test QuotaTest which copies this
#                      this file to
#                      /cephfs/cavern/home/cadcauthtest1/do-not-delete/quotaTest/.
#                      The underlying storage will detect quota limit exceeded
#                      and will throw a ByteLimitExceededException. QuotaTest
#                      looks for this exception to be thrown and catches it.
#                      In this case, the test is successful; otherwise
#                      the test is considered to have failed.
#
#                      Note that quota is set on the directory
#                      /cephfs/cavern/home/cadcauthtest1/do-not-delete/quotaTest.
#                      Hence this test file quotaTestFile.txt needs to be copied
#                      to this directory and not another directory which does
#                      not have this quota set.
